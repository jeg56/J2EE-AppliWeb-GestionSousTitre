00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:34,719
my virginity
or my liquor license

173
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:36,655
over you bitches, so pack up!

174
00:12:36,657 --> 00:12:38,723
- That's right!
- That's enough cocktails!

175
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:41,026
Clear it out!
Hello, goodbye, Roger.

176
00:12:41,028 --> 00:12:42,160
Have fun!

177
00:12:42,162 --> 00:12:43,627
Bring the drinks on out!

178
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:45,863
Do you do that often?

179
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:47,431
- Do what?
- The show.

180
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,200
Yeah, yeah. The girls
are so nice to me here.

181
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:51,869
I mean,
they would never normally

182
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:54,039
let a girl sing at
one of these shows,

183
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:56,007
but they've always
loved my voice.

184
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:58,142
They used to beg me to sing.

185
00:12:58,144 --> 00:13:01,378
It's an honor, really. I get
to be one of the gay girls.

186
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,116
Is that your real eyebrow?

187
00:13:04,651 --> 00:13:07,584
Um... No. No.

188
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:10,755
I make it out of tape.

189
00:13:10,757 --> 00:13:13,160
- Oh, so it's stuck on?
- Mmm-hmm.

190
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:17,297
Can I try to take it off?

191
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:21,699
Uh... Yeah, sure.

192
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:23,336
It's incredible
what they do.

193
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:30,776
Look at that.

194
00:13:30,778 --> 00:13:32,044
Oh! Yep. There it is.

195
00:13:32,046 --> 00:13:33,579
I should
put her down somewhere.

196
00:13:33,581 --> 00:13:34,782
Okay.

197
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:39,417
There we go.

198
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:41,085
Why're you covering your eye?

199
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:43,088
Oh, just 'cause I don't have
my eyebrow on anymore.

200
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:45,960
Oh, no, no. The whole point is
I can see your face.

201
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:48,294
Yeah, there we go.

202
00:13:54,402 --> 00:13:56,968
Why did you come back here?

203
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:00,037
Your friend brought me
back here. I'm glad he did.

204
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,675
Can I buy you a drink?

205
00:14:02,743 --> 00:14:04,175
Oh.

206
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:07,311
I gotta change,
and I got paint in my hair.

207
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:08,881
- That's not your real hair?
- My eyebrows are...

208
00:14:08,883 --> 00:14:11,082
No, my hair is
like your color.

209
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:13,921
- Oh, okay.
- But I paint it with this

210
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,954
makeup.

211
00:14:15,956 --> 00:14:17,396
I'd love to see
what that looks like.

212
00:14:18,292 --> 00:14:19,960
I'll wait for you.

213
00:14:21,428 --> 00:14:22,660
Um...

214
00:14:22,662 --> 00:14:24,329
Yeah, okay. Sure.

215
00:14:24,331 --> 00:14:27,098
Yeah, if you wanna wait, I'll
come have a drink with you.

216
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,000
Sure.

217
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:30,535
Bitch, can you get down
off that stage

218
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:32,404
and come help me
close this bar, please?

219
00:14:32,406 --> 00:14:33,905
Don't talk to me like that

220
00:14:33,907 --> 00:14:34,973
in that bus driver wig, girl.

221
00:14:34,975 --> 00:14:36,540
Oh, I know you did not.

222
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,376
What, you have a street
appointment tonight, sister?

223
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:39,710
Excuse me!

224
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,912
Mr. Maine, would you mind?

225
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:43,882
Uh... What do you
want me to do?

226
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:45,916
Just come play
a little song for me.

227
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:47,319
I don't know.

228
00:14:47,321 --> 00:14:48,920
Can you leave
the man alone, please?

229
00:14:48,922 --> 00:14:50,955
I showed you mine, you show
me yours. Come on.

230
00:14:50,957 --> 00:14:54,792
He already signed your tits,
honey. Say, "No, sir."

231
00:14:54,794 --> 00:14:56,261
Show off for me a little bit.

232
00:14:56,263 --> 00:14:58,130
I'll only do it because
you already performed.

233
00:14:58,132 --> 00:14:59,798
You're so nice.
Thank you.

234
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:03,104
Lord, the man is here
for Ally. Not for you, sister.

235
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,237
She's nice. Yeah.

236
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,473
Isn't it cute?
Little arts and crafts.

237
00:15:07,475 --> 00:15:09,274
- Yeah, and light.
- Mmm-hmm.

238
00:15:09,276 --> 00:15:11,809
- Did you do this yourself?
- Yeah, all me.

239
00:15:11,811 --> 00:15:13,080
Well, it's great.

240
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:14,880
Does this mic work?

241
00:15:14,882 --> 00:15:17,015
<i>Oh, yeah. Fuck, all right.</i>

242
00:15:17,017 --> 00:15:18,549
What do you want me to play?

243
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:20,252
I don't care, just look at me
while you do it.

244
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:22,219
Oh, Lord!
Somebody kill me now.

245
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:25,524
Let me see what I can...
All right.

246
00:15:31,065 --> 00:15:34,335

263
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,743
- It's a cop bar.
- Cops?

264
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:55,079
Yeah, that's why
they serve all night long.

265
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:02,654
Can I ask you
a personal question?

266
00:17:02,656 --> 00:17:04,088
Sure.

267
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:06,059
Do you write songs
or anything?

268
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,892
I don't sing my own songs.

269
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:10,096
Thank you.

270
00:17:11,498 --> 00:17:12,499
Why?

271
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:18,503
I just don't feel comfortable.

272
00:17:18,505 --> 00:17:20,874
Why wouldn't you
feel comfortable?

273
00:17:21,508 --> 00:17:22,673
Um...

274
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:25,243
Well, 'cause almost
every single person

275
00:17:25,245 --> 00:17:26,910
that I've come in contact with

276
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:28,279
in the music industry
has told me

277
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:29,747
that my nose is too big

278
00:17:29,749 --> 00:17:31,115
and that I won't make it.

279
00:17:31,117 --> 00:17:33,817
- Your nose is too big?
- Yeah.

280
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:36,321
Your nose is beautiful.

281
00:17:36,323 --> 00:17:37,922
Are you showing me
your nose right now?

282
00:17:37,924 --> 00:17:39,157
- Yeah.
- You don't have to show it

283
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:40,225
to me. I've been
looking at it all night.

284
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:41,758
Oh, come on. No, you're not.

285
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,495
I'm gonna be thinking about
your nose for a very long

286
00:17:43,497 --> 00:17:45,630
- time. I'm not full of shit.
- You're full of shit.

287
00:17:45,632 --> 00:17:47,164
- Yeah, you are. Yeah, you're full of shit.
- I'm telling you the truth.

288
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,432
- Can I touch your nose?
- Oh, my gosh!

289
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:50,037
Let me just touch it
for a second.

290
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:01,313
You're very lucky.

291
00:18:01,315 --> 00:18:03,948
- Oh, really? Yeah, not really.
- Mmm-hmm.

292
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,485
My nose has not made me lucky.

293
00:18:06,487 --> 00:18:08,151
I could've had
maybe a hit song

294
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:09,853
if it wasn't for my nose.

295
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:11,222
That's fucking bullshit.

296
00:18:11,224 --> 00:18:12,791
Yeah. No, it's not bullshit

297
00:18:12,793 --> 00:18:14,225
because you go
into these rooms,

298
00:18:14,227 --> 00:18:16,093
and there's all these
fucking men in there,

299
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,528
and they're
just staring at you,

300
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,296
listening to your record,
going,

301
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:22,499
"Oh, you sound great,
but you don't look so great."

302
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:25,137
You know, I had a thing
when I was little.

303
00:18:25,139 --> 00:18:28,507
I was born with this thing
in my ear, couldn't hear.

304
00:18:28,509 --> 00:18:31,808
What do I wind up being?
A singer, so you never know.

305
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:35,513
Look, talent comes everywhere.
Everybody's talented.

306
00:18:35,515 --> 00:18:37,814
Bet you fucking everybody
in this bar is talented

307
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:41,384
in one thing or another,
but having something to say

308
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:43,787
and the way to say it
so people listen to it,

309
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,023
that's a whole other bag.

310
00:18:45,025 --> 00:18:46,324
And unless you get out there

311
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:48,325
and you try to do it,
you'll never know.

312
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:49,827
That's just the truth.

313
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:51,430
If there's one reason
we're supposed to be here,

314
00:18:51,432 --> 00:18:54,365
it's to say something
so people wanna hear it.

315
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:56,000
Don't you understand
what I'm trying to tell you?

316
00:18:56,002 --> 00:18:57,369
Yeah, I do.

317
00:18:57,371 --> 00:19:00,438
I don't like it,
but I understand it.

318
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,907
Oh, I think
you like it a little bit.

319
00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:06,643
I think I'm getting through
a little bit. I can see it.

320
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,114
No, you can't.

321
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:11,417
It's a good thing we met.

322
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:13,852
- Yeah.
- For both of us.

323
00:19:13,854 --> 00:19:15,987
- Trust me.
- I don't know what is going on.

324
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:17,689
- Honestly, what...
- Who does?

325
00:19:17,691 --> 00:19:21,125
I'm in a cop bar, with
Jackson Maine. It's, like...

326
00:19:21,127 --> 00:19:22,293
Jackson Maine!

327
00:19:22,295 --> 00:19:23,628
I'm gonna wake up in a minute.

328
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,130
That's the thing
about when you get famous,

329
00:19:25,132 --> 00:19:27,497
people start saying
your full name.

330
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,801
- Well, what do you want...
- Just "Jack."

331
00:19:29,803 --> 00:19:31,702
Oh, speaking of...

332
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:32,871
Come on.

333
00:19:32,873 --> 00:19:35,573
- What?
- Did you put that on?

334
00:19:35,575 --> 00:19:39,677
You put that on. When did you
even go to the jukebox?

335
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,112
Oh, God!

336
00:19:41,114 --> 00:19:43,582
I hear that song, and I just
wanna turn it the fuck off.

337
00:19:43,584 --> 00:19:44,615
Jack Maine!

338
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:46,051
I fucked
that fucking song up so bad.

339
00:19:46,053 --> 00:19:47,818
- No! What? Come on.
- Oh, my God!

340
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,755
Hey, I know that
we're not supposed to do this.

341
00:19:50,757 --> 00:19:53,124
I know that we're not supposed
to come and bother you.

342
00:19:53,126 --> 00:19:54,793
- You come here every night.
- That's all right.

343
00:19:54,795 --> 00:19:56,660
You got your camera on you?
'Cause I don't have my camera.

344
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:57,728
Excuse me, one sec.

345
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,197
My ex-girlfriend was
fucking this guy.

346
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:00,564
- Right. Okay.
- Who looks like you,

347
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:01,865
- that's what she said.
- Shut the hell up.

348
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:02,933
But I gotta take
a picture of you

349
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:04,302
because I gotta send it to her

350
00:20:04,304 --> 00:20:05,570
because I'm gonna show her
that you look

351
00:20:05,572 --> 00:20:06,836
nothing fucking like
that fucking guy.

352
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:08,105
Jack, I'm sorry.

353
00:20:08,107 --> 00:20:09,574
Maybe that'll help her out.

354
00:20:09,576 --> 00:20:11,074
Will that help you out?
Will that make you happy?

355
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:12,310
Why don't we take
the fucking picture?

356
00:20:12,312 --> 00:20:13,644
You want someone
to take the picture?

357
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:15,080
- Hey, no, no. It's okay.
- Excuse me.

358
00:20:15,082 --> 00:20:16,647
You want someone
to take the picture?

359
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:18,249
- Get the fuck off, you little whore.
- What? What?

360
00:20:18,251 --> 00:20:20,183
- Hey, come on. Stand up, yeah.
- What?

361
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:23,187
- I'm sorry! No, Jack!
- I got you.

362
00:20:23,189 --> 00:20:24,455
- It's all right.
- Oh, my God!

363
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:26,017
- No, no, it's all right.
- Why did I...

364
00:20:28,795 --> 00:20:32,362
I'm fine, honestly. I'm okay.
This is so stupid.

365
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:35,232
No, you gotta get ahead
of the swelling.

366
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,933
Just try to find some...

367
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:39,072
This is so embarrassing.

368
00:20:40,207 --> 00:20:43,607
Here we go.
Yeah, put that on there.

369
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:46,546
Gotta wrap something up
with it. Find it.

370
00:20:48,146 --> 00:20:50,448
- You like Cheetos?
- No, like gauze.

371
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,417
- Some gauze or something.
- Gauze?

372
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:54,555
Try to do that.
With that hand.

373
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,090
And do that hand.

374
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,358
You play piano?

375
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:02,160
Yeah, we gotta
take care of this, then.

376
00:21:02,162 --> 00:21:04,698
Oh, okay. Thanks.

377
00:21:11,037 --> 00:21:13,403
And that's it, yeah. No, but
keep that on there, hold on.

378
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:16,207
Can you do that? Yeah.
Did you get it?

379
00:21:16,209 --> 00:21:17,975
It's already gotten warm,
hasn't it?

380
00:21:17,977 --> 00:21:20,380
- Should we have gotten two?
- It's okay. No, it's okay.

381
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,046
Thanks.

382
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:25,850
I'm sorry. I had to.

383
00:21:25,852 --> 00:21:27,354
That's all right.

384
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,055
It's not really all right,
though.

385
00:21:30,057 --> 00:21:31,956
Have a good one.

386
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,958
Be careful, she'll hit you.

387
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:38,596
These rings
are gonna get stuck

388
00:21:38,598 --> 00:21:40,299
if you don't take them off.

389
00:21:41,835 --> 00:21:43,534
- Does that hurt?
- Yeah.

390
00:21:43,536 --> 00:21:45,536
- That's okay, though.
- May I?

391
00:21:45,538 --> 00:21:46,706
Yeah.

392
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,648
Safekeeping.

393
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:58,850
- Put this on there.
- You're a sweetheart.

394
00:21:58,852 --> 00:22:00,517
And we'll just wrap it up.

395
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,420
You'll be good to go.

396
00:22:02,422 --> 00:22:05,090
How the hell do you deal
with that all the time?

397
00:22:05,092 --> 00:22:07,725
- What's that?
- People just

398
00:22:07,727 --> 00:22:09,626
talking to you
like you're not a real person

399
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:11,496
- or taking your picture.
- Is that too tight?

400
00:22:11,498 --> 00:22:13,564
It's okay, thanks.

401
00:22:13,566 --> 00:22:17,102
- Oh. I hurt you.
- That's fine, it's okay. Ow...

402
00:22:17,104 --> 00:22:19,903
There we go.
Now, you're mobile.

403
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:21,372
Swing it around.

404
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,508
I look like a pirate.

405
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:27,445
Right? I told you
it was worth coming here.

406
00:22:27,447 --> 00:22:29,147
How do you do that?

407
00:22:29,149 --> 00:22:31,416
- Do what?
- Don't change the subject.

408
00:22:31,418 --> 00:22:32,749
Is that what I'm doing?

409
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:34,855
Nobody ever asked you
about you, huh?

410
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:38,555
- Not sure.
- Where are you from?

411
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:39,792
Arizona.

412
00:22:41,929 --> 00:22:43,660
- Arizona boy.
- Mmm-hmm.

413
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:46,797
Dad had a midlife crisis,
I think.

414
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,732
So I've been told.

415
00:22:48,734 --> 00:22:50,767
Made his way to Arizona,
started working

416
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:54,471
for this family
on a pecan ranch.

417
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:56,442
- A pecan ranch?
- Yeah.

418
00:22:58,345 --> 00:23:01,144
Knocked up
the family's daughter.

419
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:02,913
She was just shy of 18.

420
00:23:02,915 --> 00:23:05,216
Uh-oh.

421
00:23:05,218 --> 00:23:06,750
That's when
I came into the picture.

422
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,318
Okay.
The son of an 18-year-old.

423
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,554
Yeah.

424
00:23:09,556 --> 00:23:13,024
Well, she died at childbirth.

425
00:23:13,026 --> 00:23:15,259
- Then, my dad...
- I'm sorry.

426
00:23:15,261 --> 00:23:17,561
He, uh...

427
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:19,930
He died when I was 13,

428
00:23:19,932 --> 00:23:24,000
so I guess my brother would
tell you that he raised me,

429
00:23:24,002 --> 00:23:26,703
but I don't know. I don't know
who was raising who.

430
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:32,011
Just 127 acres of nuts,
Navajo, and nowhere to go.

431
00:23:38,284 --> 00:23:42,355
<i>♪ Tell me something, boy</i>

432
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:51,530

433
00:23:54,634 --> 00:23:58,704

00:24:02,008 --> 00:24:07,614

435
00:24:08,214 --> 00:24:09,881
Is that me?

436
00:24:09,883 --> 00:24:12,383
That's you.

437
00:24:12,385 --> 00:24:14,855
- Did you just write that now?
- Yeah.

438
00:24:15,922 --> 00:24:17,457
It's pretty good.

439
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:23,496

00:24:28,601 --> 00:24:35,742

<i>♪ Longing for change ♪</i>

442
00:24:50,524 --> 00:24:54,061
I started writing this song
the other day,

443
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:05,902
and maybe that could work,
like as a chorus or something.

444
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:08,607
I have to think
if I can remember it. Uh...

445
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:14,047

00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:46,612
Holy shit.

452
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:50,816
What is this?

453
00:25:52,352 --> 00:25:54,388
Was this supposed to help me?

454
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:04,864
Can I tell you a secret?

455
00:26:08,968 --> 00:26:11,805
I think
you might be a songwriter.

456
00:26:16,976 --> 00:26:19,813
But don't worry,
I won't tell anybody.

457
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:25,615
But I'm not very good
at keeping secrets.

458
00:26:32,525 --> 00:26:34,694
You're a real gentleman.

459
00:26:36,229 --> 00:26:37,596
I think.

460
00:26:49,808 --> 00:26:51,641
Thank you, sir.
It's right here, on the right.

461
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:52,876
- Right there?
- Which one?

462
00:26:52,878 --> 00:26:54,912
- This one.
- Oh, yeah.

463
00:26:54,914 --> 00:26:56,479
What's all this?

464
00:26:56,481 --> 00:27:00,417
Oh, it's my dad.
It's a long story.

465
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:02,186
What's he, a sheikh?

466
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:06,122
No, he's a driver.

467
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:09,962
Hey, I got a gig.
You wanna come?

468
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:11,895
When?

469
00:27:11,897 --> 00:27:13,064
We're headed
to the airport now.

470
00:27:13,066 --> 00:27:15,232
- Tonight.
- Tonight? No, I can't.

471
00:27:15,234 --> 00:27:18,369
I gotta go to work later.
I gotta go to bed.

472
00:27:18,371 --> 00:27:21,537
Who's gonna take care of your
hand? I messed it up, or...

473
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:22,974
- Me.
- No, no!

474
00:27:22,976 --> 00:27:24,542
- I'll take care of my hand.
- It's my fault.

475
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:25,943
- I took you to that place.
- That's okay.

476
00:27:25,945 --> 00:27:27,613
No, listen. Hey!

477
00:27:29,015 --> 00:27:32,482
- You have my number.
- Okay. All right.

478
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:38,389
Hey.

479
00:27:38,391 --> 00:27:40,357
What?

480
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:43,393
I just wanted to take
another look at you.

481
00:28:05,518 --> 00:28:07,787
Oh, maybe I fucked that up.

482
00:28:08,387 --> 00:28:10,721
No.

483
00:28:10,723 --> 00:28:13,224
- Hi, Dad.
- Pretty late, pretty late.

484
00:28:13,226 --> 00:28:14,758
- Oh, is it late?
- Yeah.

485
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,880
Look at you, you don't even
know where you're walking.

486
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:19,596
- Come on.
- Well, I wanna go to bed.

487
00:28:19,598 --> 00:28:20,997
No, come in for two minutes.

488
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:23,936
It's Wolfie's birthday,
come on!

489
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:26,469
- Two minutes!
- Okay.

490
00:28:26,471 --> 00:28:28,305
- Wolfie!
- Yeah, sweetheart?

491
00:28:28,307 --> 00:28:29,840
Who was the guy in the car?

492
00:28:29,842 --> 00:28:30,940
I don't know
what you're talking about.

493
00:28:30,942 --> 00:28:32,343
- Hey, Ally.
- How's it goin'?

494
00:28:32,345 --> 00:28:34,879
- Happy birthday.
- Hey, "happy birthday"?

495
00:28:34,881 --> 00:28:36,447
- Yeah.
- It's not my birthday.

496
00:28:36,449 --> 00:28:37,614
What do you mean?

497
00:28:37,616 --> 00:28:38,882
- Come on.
- No, I was just saying...

498
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:41,718
What the hell happened
in here? My God!

499
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,286
This place is a mess!

500
00:28:43,288 --> 00:28:45,023
Starting gate
is Shipazo Gito

501
00:28:45,025 --> 00:28:46,856
and bad beat is Wario Peito.

502
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:48,558
What's going on?
You leave the butter out.

503
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,061
Who the hell's
betting on horses

504
00:28:50,063 --> 00:28:51,995
- at breakfast time in Japan?
- It's not

505
00:28:51,997 --> 00:28:53,530
- breakfast time in Japan.
- They're loading!

506
00:28:53,532 --> 00:28:55,298
- Joe, we're going. Come on!
- You guys are crazy!

507
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,901
Have a sizable
investment on this thing here.

508
00:28:56,903 --> 00:28:58,936
What did I say about smoking
in this house?

509
00:28:58,938 --> 00:29:00,670
- Outside!
- Who are you?

510
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:02,006
Who am I?
It's my house.

511
00:29:02,008 --> 00:29:03,774
I know it's your house.
But you smoke too.

512
00:29:03,776 --> 00:29:05,209
- All right, forget it.
- Okay, good.

513
00:29:05,211 --> 00:29:07,314
Sweetheart, you're happy here,
aren't you?

514
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:09,346
I'm happy, Dad.

515
00:29:09,348 --> 00:29:11,649
I'm just saying,
she's got no space.

516
00:29:11,651 --> 00:29:13,851
- What are you saying?
- Wait a minute, sweetheart.

517
00:29:13,853 --> 00:29:15,251
- I'm saying she's got no space.
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

518
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:17,555
I want my friends
to look at you.

519
00:29:17,557 --> 00:29:19,157
Take a good look.

520
00:29:19,159 --> 00:29:23,095
With a voice like from heaven,
but you know what?

521
00:29:25,999 --> 00:29:28,899
It's not always the best
singers that make it.

522
00:29:28,901 --> 00:29:31,968
You know?
I knew a couple of guys

523
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:34,537
could sing Sinatra
under the table.

524
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:37,341
But Frank, he'd come on stage
with the blue eyes,

525
00:29:37,343 --> 00:29:40,710
the sharkskin suit,
the patent leather shoes...

526
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:43,814
He becomes Frank Sinatra.

527
00:29:43,816 --> 00:29:47,450
And everybody else,
all these other guys

528
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:51,191
that really got it,
that really have it inside,

529
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:54,360
just a bunch of nobodies.

530
00:29:55,493 --> 00:29:58,228
Okay. Everybody, let's go.

531
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,630
Time for work.

532
00:30:11,343 --> 00:30:13,709
Unfortunately,
you keep blasting the hearing,

533
00:30:13,711 --> 00:30:15,078
it's not gonna come back.

534
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,647
I think it's time
we reconsider

535
00:30:16,649 --> 00:30:18,082
- the inner monitors.
- Mmm-hmm.

536
00:30:18,084 --> 00:30:19,417
We've talked about
that with Bobby

537
00:30:19,419 --> 00:30:21,183
- a couple of weeks ago.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

538
00:30:21,185 --> 00:30:23,153
If we put the inner moles in,
we can actually use those

539
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:25,023
to amplify the high
frequencies.

540
00:30:25,025 --> 00:30:26,524
- Yeah, okay, that sounds great.
- Cut down the sound.

541
00:30:26,526 --> 00:30:28,058
- Yeah, you're right. Yeah.
- I'm gonna talk to Bobby,

542
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,359
and we're gonna
get something set up.

543
00:30:29,361 --> 00:30:30,594
Sold. I'm sold.

544
00:30:30,596 --> 00:30:32,729
- All right, Jack.
- Yeah, call Bobby.

545
00:30:32,731 --> 00:30:34,297
Stubborn son of a bitch.

546
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:35,966
<i>All right, let's get
ready. 1, 2, 3, 4.</i>

547
00:30:46,278 --> 00:30:50,749
<i>♪ Killing me, baby,
with the things you do</i>

548
00:30:51,816 --> 00:30:54,918
<i>♪ You put me in the ground ♪</i>

549
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,853
<i>We're trying...</i>

550
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,758
You gotta put 'em in, man.

551
00:31:02,028 --> 00:31:03,460
I told you,
I can't wear those things.

552
00:31:03,462 --> 00:31:05,062
When I wear 'em,
it's just in my head,

553
00:31:05,064 --> 00:31:06,729
and I need to be here
with everybody else.

554
00:31:06,731 --> 00:31:08,565
The doctor said
it's the only way

555
00:31:08,567 --> 00:31:10,834
to manage this thing, Jack.

556
00:31:10,836 --> 00:31:13,035
You're not gonna
get back what you lost.

557
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:15,773
It's the only way we can
manage what you still got.

558
00:31:15,775 --> 00:31:17,440
Oh, wow.

559
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:19,744
I think
we're managing pretty good.

560
00:31:19,746 --> 00:31:21,881
What do you
want me to do?

561
00:31:25,284 --> 00:31:26,984
<i>The door's wide open
if you wanna go.</i>

562
00:31:26,986 --> 00:31:28,955
You know what?
Don't start that shit.

563
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:35,258
Show a little fucking pride
in what you're doing, buddy.

564
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:38,328
I just wanna know if she's
on her way or not, that's all.

565
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:40,299
Who's coming?

566
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,799
What the fuck?

567
00:31:43,801 --> 00:31:45,702
- Who's here?
- I have no idea.

568
00:31:45,704 --> 00:31:47,103
He won't tell me.

569
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:50,908
- Hi, Ally.
- Hi.

570
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:52,476
- I'm Phil. We met last night.
- Yeah, I remember.

571
00:31:52,478 --> 00:31:54,844
Jack sent me to pick you up
and take you to the gig.

572
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:56,613
Oh, my God. Um...

573
00:31:56,615 --> 00:31:59,249
But I gotta work. I can't go.

574
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:00,718
He's really
looking forward to this.

575
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,486
I really appreciate that,
but, uh...

576
00:32:02,488 --> 00:32:04,054
I can't leave,
so I'll be in my car

577
00:32:04,056 --> 00:32:05,456
right down the street.

578
00:32:05,458 --> 00:32:07,123
Please tell him,
"Thank you, but no thank you."

579
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:08,859
Okay? Say it just like that.

580
00:32:08,861 --> 00:32:09,926
Wait a minute, Ally.
What're you doing?

581
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,228
The fuck is that shit?

582
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:12,630
- This is crazy.
- What are you doing?

583
00:32:12,632 --> 00:32:14,231
- This is great.
- What the hell's going on?

584
00:32:14,233 --> 00:32:16,432
Look, a guy like that
invites you to a show...

585
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:18,768
- It could be a great opportunity.
- Dad, don't start with me.

586
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,470
- Don't start!
- Listen, listen!

587
00:32:20,472 --> 00:32:22,972
Does he know you sing at all?
Did he hear anything from you?

588
00:32:22,974 --> 00:32:24,408
Dad, I gotta go to work.

589
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:25,676
This could be
the opportunity of a lifetime.

590
00:32:25,678 --> 00:32:27,178
I don't have the same disease

591
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,612
that you have, Dad.
You get around celebrities,

592
00:32:28,614 --> 00:32:30,447
and it's like
they're gonna rub off on you.

593
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:31,981
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?

594
00:32:31,983 --> 00:32:33,217
"Oh, you know who I drove
the other day?"

595
00:32:33,219 --> 00:32:34,285
Why are you talking
about that?

596
00:32:34,287 --> 00:32:35,786
Like magic, now you're famous.

597
00:32:35,788 --> 00:32:37,287
And you're not.
It's not magic, Dad.

598
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:38,455
Sweetheart.

599
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:40,860
He's a drunk!
You know all about drunks.

600
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:52,201
Sweetheart, he's still there.

601
00:32:52,203 --> 00:32:53,804
Yo, so you fucking hit a cop?

602
00:32:53,806 --> 00:32:55,506
Yeah, he was being
an asshole to Jack,

603
00:32:55,508 --> 00:32:58,041
so I fucking popped him
in the face.

604
00:32:58,043 --> 00:32:59,308
Yo, that is so gangster.

605
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,112
So, then we ended up
in a parking lot,

606
00:33:01,114 --> 00:33:02,612
and he was putting peas
around my hand to fix my hand.

607
00:33:02,614 --> 00:33:04,480
And then he was singing,
and I was singing.

608
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:06,182
I don't know
what the hell's going on.

609
00:33:06,184 --> 00:33:07,951
But now he's got his driver
following me around.

610
00:33:07,953 --> 00:33:09,253
Wait, he's been following you

611
00:33:09,255 --> 00:33:10,654
from your house
all the way to work?

612
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,922
- Yes! It's crazy!
- You're fucking late again.

613
00:33:11,924 --> 00:33:13,524
I'm what?

614
00:33:13,526 --> 00:33:15,394
I said you're late!

615
00:33:23,836 --> 00:33:25,204
Are we doing this?

616
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:32,508
Hey, Bryan, I'm out.

617
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,509
Find somebody else.

618
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:35,012
Bryan, I'll be back.
I promise.

619
00:33:35,014 --> 00:33:36,979
- <i>Papo,</i> I promise.
- See ya. I won't.

620
00:33:38,951 --> 00:33:40,750
- Did you see Bryan's face?
- Oh, shit!

621
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:42,521
Hey, great!
Let's do this.

622
00:33:43,222 --> 00:33:44,523
Let's go.

623
00:33:45,257 --> 00:33:47,658
What are we doing?

624
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,826
You know,
if I didn't know Jack,

625
00:33:49,828 --> 00:33:51,728
I would call you a stalker.

626
00:33:52,932 --> 00:33:55,168
Yeah, sorry about that.

627
00:33:56,669 --> 00:33:59,205
Yes, man!

628
00:34:02,775 --> 00:34:06,142
Lay on that couch right now!
I'm gonna take my shoes off.

629
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:07,577
- Oh, my God!
- This is nice.

630
00:34:07,579 --> 00:34:09,045
How this shit works?

631
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:11,214
- They just told you no.
- Oh, okay. I'm so sorry.

632
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:12,951
Oh, shit!

633
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:17,721
I could get used to this shit.

634
00:34:17,723 --> 00:34:18,955
You need to date
more rock stars,

635
00:34:18,957 --> 00:34:20,056
baby girl,
you know what I'm saying?

636
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:21,491
We're not dating.

637
00:34:32,004 --> 00:34:33,904
Hi, Ally. I'm Gail.

638
00:34:33,906 --> 00:34:35,471
<i>- Hi.

639
00:34:35,473 --> 00:34:37,007
Oh, you guys can leave your bags.
We'll grab 'em in a sec.

640
00:34:37,009 --> 00:34:38,341

- Oh. Okay, sure.

641
00:34:38,343 --> 00:34:40,212
- Okay. Yeah.
- Thanks.

642
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:46,384
Did you have
a good trip?

643
00:34:46,386 --> 00:34:47,417
Yeah.

644
00:34:49,955 --> 00:34:51,487
Passes.

645
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:53,256
- Oh, thank you.
- Put 'em around your necks.

646
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:55,560
Ear plugs. You'll need these,
it's loud up there.

647
00:34:57,129 --> 00:34:58,629
Yeah, I got 'em.
We're coming in.

648
00:34:58,631 --> 00:35:00,700

to the side stage.

- It's all good.
- I'm so sorry.

652
00:35:07,906 --> 00:35:09,138
This place is so big.
I'm just...

Oh, watch yourself.

- I'm good. Hi!

676
00:37:47,799 --> 00:37:48,966
It's so good to see you.

677
00:37:48,968 --> 00:37:50,266
How are you?
It was so good.

678
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,502
Everything all right?
The trip was fine?

679
00:37:51,504 --> 00:37:52,935
- Yeah, yeah.
- Phil was all right?

680
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:54,737
- Didn't bother you at all?
- Gail was so nice.

681
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:56,973
So, listen, we're gonna sing
that song, all right?

682
00:37:56,975 --> 00:37:59,209
I did an arrangement,
it was kind of not so great,

683
00:37:59,211 --> 00:38:00,710
but maybe you could
just stick with it.

684
00:38:00,712 --> 00:38:02,145
No, I can't do that.
I'm sorry. No, Jack, please.

685
00:38:02,147 --> 00:38:03,446
Yeah, you're coming.
Here we go.

686
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:05,383
It's not funny.
Jack, don't fuck around.

687
00:38:06,352 --> 00:38:09,051
All you gotta do is trust me.

688
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:10,822
That's all you gotta do.

689
00:38:13,158 --> 00:38:15,461
I'm gonna
sing it either way, so...

690
00:38:26,538 --> 00:38:27,837
Steve...

691
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:30,806
You lost your mind. Okay.

692
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:33,509

Pretty fucking good.

728
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:09,225
You see, the way
the guitar just started and...

729
00:42:09,227 --> 00:42:10,661
I thought maybe
I set it in the wrong key,

730
00:42:10,663 --> 00:42:11,928
and then the tempo
was too fast.

731
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:13,562
No, it was
so beautiful, and...

- Yeah.

00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:43,359

00:42:43,361 --> 00:42:44,627

Just give me one second.

Where's the fucking...

749
00:43:19,198 --> 00:43:20,199
Okay.

00:43:49,093 --> 00:43:50,095
Hey.

00:43:52,163 --> 00:43:53,395
Jack?

752
00:43:53,397 --> 00:43:55,131
I don't know, wake him up.

753
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:56,533
I can't wake him up.
He's drunk.

754
00:43:56,535 --> 00:43:57,634
Yes, you can!

755
00:43:57,636 --> 00:43:58,902
Shake your titties in his face

756
00:43:58,904 --> 00:44:00,703

and just fucking...

757
00:44:00,705 --> 00:44:02,337
You know what I'm saying?
Take two shots and...

758
00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:04,908
Thank you so much for your help.
You are so helpful.

759
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:06,977
Let me know how it goes, baby.

760
00:44:15,087 --> 00:44:16,489
Go home, pal.

761
00:44:24,395 --> 00:44:25,930
He's out.

762
00:44:28,267 --> 00:44:31,203
You think maybe
he drinks a bit much?

763
00:44:34,872 --> 00:44:37,175
Sweetie, you have no idea.

764
00:44:38,477 --> 00:44:40,076
Tell you one thing, though.

765
00:44:40,078 --> 00:44:43,047
He's never brought a girl
onstage before.

766
00:44:45,049 --> 00:44:46,848
And it's been
a long, long time

767
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:49,285
since he played like that.

768
00:44:49,287 --> 00:44:51,524
Well, that's good to know.

769
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:57,053
One time,
my brother came home,

770
00:45:57,055 --> 00:45:58,553
I was playing on this upright

771
00:45:58,555 --> 00:46:00,290
we used to
always have in our den.

772
00:46:00,292 --> 00:46:02,091
And I was in my own world.

773
00:46:02,093 --> 00:46:03,759
No one was ever home,
and then he comes home

774
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:06,428
to take care of my dad,
who was sick.

775
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:09,165
And he's sittin' there,
and he's looking at me.

776
00:46:09,167 --> 00:46:10,699
I swear to God,
he looked at me

777
00:46:10,701 --> 00:46:12,835
like I was special
or something,

778
00:46:12,837 --> 00:46:14,937
and it just kind
of filled me up.

779
00:46:14,939 --> 00:46:17,339
I should've never
told you that. I don't know.

780
00:46:17,341 --> 00:46:18,641
Why?

781
00:46:18,643 --> 00:46:19,843
'Cause it's embarrassing.
I don't know.

782
00:46:19,845 --> 00:46:21,444
It's so sweet.

783
00:46:21,446 --> 00:46:23,312
'Cause you're nothing like
my brother, let me just say.

784
00:46:23,314 --> 00:46:24,848
Yeah, I don't look
like your brother?

785
00:46:24,850 --> 00:46:27,850
He's a fucking
old man, okay.

786
00:46:27,852 --> 00:46:30,252
My dad had me
when he was 63 years old.

787
00:46:30,254 --> 00:46:31,587
63 years old?

788
00:46:31,589 --> 00:46:33,658
And we have
different mothers, so...

789
00:46:36,028 --> 00:46:39,094
What's that number down here?

790
00:46:39,096 --> 00:46:41,564
That is how many people
looked at it.

791
00:46:41,566 --> 00:46:43,065
Get the fuck out of here.

792
00:46:43,067 --> 00:46:44,567
How do they know
how many people looked at it?

793
00:46:44,569 --> 00:46:47,337
I think it's... They call it
an algorithm, or...

794
00:46:47,339 --> 00:46:48,737
What's an algorithm?

795
00:46:48,739 --> 00:46:50,373
It's like a beat.

796
00:46:50,375 --> 00:46:52,808
- A beat?
- Yeah. Yeah.

797
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,344

00:50:04,569 --> 00:50:05,571
I don't know.

855
00:50:06,803 --> 00:50:08,606
It's like the hot air

856
00:50:12,643 --> 00:50:15,277
and the history, I don't know.

857
00:50:15,279 --> 00:50:17,145
Bought the ranch, though,
I grew up on,

858
00:50:17,147 --> 00:50:20,248
gave it to my brother.

859
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:22,051
We buried Dad there, and so
I just wanted to make sure

860
00:50:22,053 --> 00:50:25,555
that nobody paved
over his grave

861
00:50:25,557 --> 00:50:27,924
- or any of that kind of shit.
- Is it around here?

862
00:50:27,926 --> 00:50:29,357
It's not far.

863
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:31,963
Why don't we just go there?
It's nearby.

864
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:46,011
Jack?

865
00:50:54,852 --> 00:50:56,118
Yeah, if he shows up.

866
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,319
These guys have been
vamping out there

867
00:50:57,321 --> 00:50:58,922
for a fucking half an hour.

868
00:50:58,924 --> 00:51:01,056
It's time to fucking get on.

869
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:02,393
Don't you
get tired of being...

870
00:51:04,794 --> 00:51:07,263
You sold Dad's ranch.

871
00:51:07,265 --> 00:51:10,535
They turned it into
a fucking wind farm!

872
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:16,307
I bought that for you.

873
00:51:19,611 --> 00:51:21,210
Where's his grave?

874
00:51:21,212 --> 00:51:23,980
He washed away
in a fucking storm.

875
00:51:23,982 --> 00:51:26,418
His grave isn't there anymore.

876
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:30,319
I told you,
but you were fucking drunk.

877
00:51:30,321 --> 00:51:32,355
You were fucking loaded

878
00:51:32,357 --> 00:51:35,393
and already pissing yourself
a swan song.

879
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:39,763
Fuck if you shed a tear
for that piece of shit

880
00:51:39,765 --> 00:51:43,167
you idolize for
no goddamn fucking reason.

881
00:51:46,803 --> 00:51:49,173
All Dad ever did for you

882
00:51:50,375 --> 00:51:53,709
was make you
his fucking drinking buddy.

883
00:51:53,711 --> 00:51:55,877
And you'd be right there with
him if he was still alive,

884
00:51:55,879 --> 00:51:58,149
and you fucking know it.

885
00:52:00,752 --> 00:52:02,319
What did you think,

886
00:52:02,321 --> 00:52:05,388
that I was gonna fucking
take care of it

887
00:52:05,390 --> 00:52:07,357
while I'm fucking
cradling your ass

888
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:09,694
all over the goddamn world.

889
00:52:15,901 --> 00:52:17,102
Yeah.

890
00:52:19,337 --> 00:52:20,768
That's a good excuse.

891
00:52:20,770 --> 00:52:22,071
Raising a little brother,

892
00:52:22,073 --> 00:52:23,172
so you don't have
to deal with the fact

893
00:52:23,174 --> 00:52:25,707
that you were no fucking good.

894
00:52:25,709 --> 00:52:29,313
If I was no good, why'd
you steal my fucking voice?

895
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:32,147
Huh?

896
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:34,151
'Cause you had
nothing to fucking say.

897
00:52:38,656 --> 00:52:42,227
You were too proud to sing
any of the songs I ever wrote.

898
00:52:45,062 --> 00:52:47,196
Well, I got something
to say now, pal.

899
00:52:47,198 --> 00:52:50,067
I'm done being
your fucking errand boy.

900
00:52:52,504 --> 00:52:53,672
I quit.

901
00:53:00,044 --> 00:53:01,877
Yeah, my voice
just got up on me

902
00:53:01,879 --> 00:53:03,712
a few months ago and

903
00:53:03,714 --> 00:53:07,716
another shot of steroids
is better safe than sorry.

904
00:53:07,718 --> 00:53:10,721
Thank you for that,
and yeah, we should be good.

905
00:53:26,504 --> 00:53:27,506
Hey.

906
00:53:29,674 --> 00:53:30,809

goes way beyond just this.

999
01:00:42,506 --> 01:00:43,906
There's people
who need to hear

1000

to say musically.

1001
01:00:46,743 --> 01:00:48,176

1002
01:00:48,178 --> 01:00:50,812

01:00:50,814 --> 01:00:53,181
I think you have it all. I do.

1004
01:00:53,183 --> 01:00:55,086
And the question to you is,
"What do you want?"

1005
01:00:56,953 --> 01:01:00,254
I'm in that position, to put
you wherever you want to be.

1006
01:01:00,256 --> 01:01:03,560
I don't... I don't have...

1007
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:08,564
I gotta talk to Jack.

1008
01:01:08,566 --> 01:01:10,565
He said
he thought Interscope Records

1009
01:01:10,567 --> 01:01:12,266
might really wanna sign me,

1010
01:01:12,268 --> 01:01:15,370
and he said that he has
this wonderful studio

1011
01:01:15,372 --> 01:01:17,138
with a beautiful live room.

1012
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:19,475
And these amazing producers
he wants to bring in

1013
01:01:19,477 --> 01:01:21,911
to record my songs.

1014
01:01:21,913 --> 01:01:23,846
And he loves
"Look What I've Found."

1015
01:01:23,848 --> 01:01:26,047
Remember the song
we did in the diner?

1016
01:01:26,049 --> 01:01:27,515
Remember,
when we were driving?

1017
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:28,819
Yeah.

1018
01:01:29,553 --> 01:01:30,919
Yeah?

1019
01:01:30,921 --> 01:01:33,321
I mean, it was so nice
talking to him,

1020
01:01:33,323 --> 01:01:35,658
and he really believes in me.

1021
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:39,328
- You all right, Jack?
- He's okay. He's fine.

1022
01:01:39,330 --> 01:01:40,999
He does this all the time.

1023
01:01:42,332 --> 01:01:44,001
Hey, Jack.

1024
01:01:49,239 --> 01:01:50,241
Thanks.

1025
01:01:52,109 --> 01:01:53,310
What's going on?

1026
01:01:54,578 --> 01:01:55,947
Hmm?

1027
01:01:56,881 --> 01:01:58,283
What're you doing?

1028
01:02:08,758 --> 01:02:11,194
You jealous fuck.

1029
01:02:13,564 --> 01:02:15,364
I'm so happy for you.

1030
01:02:15,366 --> 01:02:17,598
Oh, you are?

1031
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:20,969
Oh! Jackson!

1032
01:02:20,971 --> 01:02:23,041
Oh, my God!

1033
01:02:25,142 --> 01:02:27,311
Jack. Stop!

1034
01:02:29,546 --> 01:02:32,583
Why're you so jealous,
boy? Hmm?

1035
01:02:34,618 --> 01:02:36,518
What're you doing?

1036
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:38,823
What's wrong? You upset?

1037
01:02:40,991 --> 01:02:43,357
You want me to
make you less...

1038
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:45,662
I know, do you wanna play?
Okay, let's play.

1039
01:02:49,366 --> 01:02:51,399
What the hell is this?

1040
01:02:51,401 --> 01:02:53,402
- I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.
- <i>No, you're fine. You're all fine.</i>

1041
01:02:53,404 --> 01:02:55,904
<i>- You sound great, okay?
- You're doing great.</i>

1042
01:02:55,906 --> 01:02:57,975
<i>We'll do it again.
I'm gonna cue you in.</i>

1043
01:03:00,544 --> 01:03:02,944
- One, two...
- <i>♪ I'm alone in my house ♪</i>

1044
01:03:02,946 --> 01:03:04,680
One second, one second.
Listen to my cue.

1045
01:03:04,682 --> 01:03:06,047
We'll come right in, okay?

1046
01:03:06,049 --> 01:03:08,750
<i>So, should...
Well, uh...</i>

1047
01:03:08,752 --> 01:03:11,286
<i>I'm sorry, but will I
sing in the beginning?</i>

1048
01:03:11,288 --> 01:03:12,888
So you're gonna
hear the second line,

1049
01:03:12,890 --> 01:03:14,623
and then I wanna
start recording.

1050
01:03:14,625 --> 01:03:18,560
I think I got an idea that
might help out, all right?

1051
01:03:18,562 --> 01:03:19,861
Yeah, please. Be my guest.

1052
01:03:19,863 --> 01:03:21,997
That was really good
up to that point.

1053
01:03:21,999 --> 01:03:24,877
- I'm just gonna go in there for a second, all right?
- All right, Jack.

1054
01:03:24,901 --> 01:03:26,268
I've never sang
with a track before.

1055
01:03:26,270 --> 01:03:27,969
I think it's because
you need your piano.

1056
01:03:27,971 --> 01:03:29,504
I think if you're playing it
and singing it...

1057
01:03:29,506 --> 01:03:31,640
Yeah, I always play it
on the piano. I'll be fine.

1058
01:03:31,642 --> 01:03:34,109
I'm just gonna have them fly
one in, and we'll try it there

1059
01:03:34,111 --> 01:03:36,381
- and see where it goes.
- You think that's okay?

1060
01:03:37,348 --> 01:03:38,480
Okay. Thank you.

1061
01:03:38,482 --> 01:03:39,681
I got you.
You're doing great.

1062
01:03:39,683 --> 01:03:41,149
- You okay?
- No, I'm so nervous.

1063
01:03:41,151 --> 01:03:43,754
- You look so beautiful.
- Thank you.

1064
01:03:44,555 --> 01:03:45,757
Thank you.

1065
01:03:56,066 --> 01:03:59,002
<i>♪ I'm alone in my house</i>

1066
01:04:01,004 --> 01:04:03,874

01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:09,611

1072
01:04:28,064 --> 01:04:31,832
Oh, so you guys have already
met the new girl, have you?

1073
01:04:31,834 --> 01:04:34,069
- Rez! What's the plan?
- What's up?

1074
01:04:34,071 --> 01:04:36,237
Yo, thanks for doing this,
man. I appreciate it.

1075
01:04:36,239 --> 01:04:39,174
This is pop music, kids.
We have a battle to do, okay?

1076
01:04:39,176 --> 01:04:41,343
You are the troops,
so if I call you troops,

1077
01:04:41,345 --> 01:04:43,678
just know that
we're going into battle.

1078
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:44,879
What is my lyrics, Ally?

1079
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:46,848
<i>♪ Just don't keep me waiting</i>

1080
01:04:46,850 --> 01:04:48,649
Yes! Again, give me that.

1081
01:04:48,651 --> 01:04:50,919
<i>♪ When I can't inspire myself</i>

1082
01:04:50,921 --> 01:04:54,522
- Breathe! Yes!
- <i>♪ I need you to provide for me ♪</i>

1083
01:04:54,524 --> 01:04:57,893
This is just fine-tuning
and creating an image.

1084
01:04:57,895 --> 01:04:59,227
I know,
I just don't wanna lose

1085
01:04:59,229 --> 01:05:02,464
the part of me
that's talented.

1086
01:05:02,466 --> 01:05:04,232
I'm not gonna let you
lose that piece.

1087
01:05:04,234 --> 01:05:05,801
I'm not gonna let you
lose that piece.

1088
01:05:05,803 --> 01:05:07,205
Okay.

1089
01:05:11,609 --> 01:05:14,209
What are we gonna do with you?

1090
01:05:14,211 --> 01:05:16,310
What are we gonna do with...
Oh, he's beautiful!

1091
01:05:16,312 --> 01:05:17,946
"You can't send me back.
I'm too cute."

1092
01:05:17,948 --> 01:05:19,982
- Hey, he's got your eyelashes.
- Mmm-hmm.

1093
01:05:19,984 --> 01:05:24,118
He does. He's got
your eyelashes. Hey, bud!

1094
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:26,955
This has never been done
before, just so you know.

1095
01:05:26,957 --> 01:05:30,058
It actually has
been done before.

1096
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:32,127
Would you please...

1097
01:05:32,129 --> 01:05:34,062
Please. Do it for me.

1098
01:05:34,064 --> 01:05:37,368
No, I can't in the water.

1099
01:06:05,629 --> 01:06:07,531
You comin' with me to Memphis?

1100
01:06:09,866 --> 01:06:13,368
- What are you talkin' about?
- I gotta go do this, um...

1101
01:06:13,370 --> 01:06:15,972
You know,
it's one of those paid things.

1102
01:06:16,807 --> 01:06:18,908
Soul-crushing work, really,

1103
01:06:18,910 --> 01:06:20,209
but it's just kind of never

1104
01:06:20,211 --> 01:06:21,676
what I thought
I'd wind up doing, maybe.

1105
01:06:21,678 --> 01:06:24,680
I don't know, but...

1106
01:06:24,682 --> 01:06:27,381
I've made peace with it,
though.

1107
01:06:27,383 --> 01:06:30,585
Anyway, if you wanna come,
I thought

1108
01:06:30,587 --> 01:06:33,053
we'd have a laugh,
at the very least.

1109
01:06:33,055 --> 01:06:34,989
Rez wants to
keep me here because,

1110
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:37,091
you know,
they rushed out the single,

1111
01:06:37,093 --> 01:06:38,560
and they were so excited

1112
01:06:38,562 --> 01:06:40,294
that they want me to
finish the album.

1113
01:06:40,296 --> 01:06:43,765
- So I'm working on that.
- Listen to what you're saying.

1114
01:06:43,767 --> 01:06:47,002
Listen to what you just said.

1115
01:06:47,004 --> 01:06:48,536
People wanna hear
what you have to say.

1116
01:06:48,538 --> 01:06:50,705
- That's the stuff right there.
- I know. I can't...

1117
01:06:50,707 --> 01:06:53,544
Hey, hey. Take it in.

1118
01:06:55,479 --> 01:06:56,911
Thank you, by the way.

1119
01:06:56,913 --> 01:06:58,346
Thank you for what?

1120
01:06:58,348 --> 01:07:00,047
Giving me a home.

1121
01:07:00,049 --> 01:07:02,319
This place never
felt like one before.

1122
01:07:39,723 --> 01:07:42,022
Oh, fuck.

1123
01:07:42,024 --> 01:07:44,127
Jack, you okay?

1124
01:07:45,029 --> 01:07:46,530
Jack?

Oh, my... Oh, my... Hey!

1144
01:08:57,935 --> 01:08:59,800
- Pretty incredible.
- Did Jack show up?

1145
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:01,202
I haven't heard from him.

1146
01:09:01,204 --> 01:09:02,504
What do you mean,
you haven't heard from him?

1147
01:09:02,506 --> 01:09:04,438
I haven't heard
from him all night.

1148
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:05,907
I haven't been able to find him.
I called him three times.

1149
01:09:05,909 --> 01:09:07,576
Listen, what happened
with the dancers there?

1150
01:09:07,578 --> 01:09:09,745
Well, I just thought
that I should do it alone

1151
01:09:09,747 --> 01:09:11,412
'cause it's so overwhelming.

1152
01:09:11,414 --> 01:09:13,180
Okay, but you can't
go rogue on me.

1153
01:09:13,182 --> 01:09:15,951
You have to understand
that this is what I do,

1154
01:09:15,953 --> 01:09:17,519
and you have to
trust me, okay?

1155
01:09:17,521 --> 01:09:19,455
So, if I give you
a couple of dancers,

1156
01:09:19,457 --> 01:09:23,461
don't not use them and then
miss a couple of steps, okay?

1157
01:09:25,128 --> 01:09:26,493
We also have to
change your hair.

1158
01:09:26,495 --> 01:09:28,028
We have to
change the color of your hair.

1159
01:09:28,030 --> 01:09:29,732
What's wrong with my hair?

1160
01:09:29,734 --> 01:09:31,166
I'm thinking platinum, or...

1161
01:09:31,168 --> 01:09:33,102
I don't wanna be
fucking blond.

1162
01:09:33,104 --> 01:09:36,871
I am who I am,
and I'm worried about Jack.

1163
01:09:36,873 --> 01:09:39,574
I will find Jack, okay?

1164
01:09:39,576 --> 01:09:41,012
I will find him.

1165
01:09:46,717 --> 01:09:49,018
Jack.

1166
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:51,321
I feel like
we've done this before.

1167
01:09:53,356 --> 01:09:54,988
Didn't think
we'd do it so soon, man.

1168
01:09:54,990 --> 01:09:56,326
Come on, bro. Get up.

1169
01:09:58,395 --> 01:10:01,962
All right. There we go.

1170
01:10:03,633 --> 01:10:05,800
<i>In my mind,
I made it to the door.</i>

1171
01:10:05,802 --> 01:10:07,135
<i>I almost didn't wake you.</i>

1172
01:10:07,137 --> 01:10:08,506
<i>You looked so comfortable.</i>

1173
01:10:10,207 --> 01:10:11,607
How you doin'?

1174
01:10:11,609 --> 01:10:15,343
You know, I've seen
better days, I guess.

1175
01:10:15,345 --> 01:10:18,714
I apologize for
disrespecting your property...

1176
01:10:18,716 --> 01:10:20,014
No apologies necessary.

1177
01:10:20,016 --> 01:10:21,416
...or whatever I did.

1178
01:10:21,418 --> 01:10:22,984
- It's fine.
- You want some coffee?

1179
01:10:22,986 --> 01:10:24,286
Be great,
why don't you put some on,

1180
01:10:24,288 --> 01:10:25,353
and we'll come in in a minute?

1181
01:10:25,355 --> 01:10:27,058
Okay.

1182
01:10:28,424 --> 01:10:31,192
That's him, right?
That's your boy.

1183
01:10:31,194 --> 01:10:34,563
Jack, he's as old now

1184
01:10:34,565 --> 01:10:37,201
as you were when I met you.

1185
01:10:38,435 --> 01:10:40,201
Saw you on YouTube.

1186
01:10:40,203 --> 01:10:43,406
- That video with the girl.
- Yeah.

1187
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:46,308
It made me happy, man.

1188
01:10:46,310 --> 01:10:49,245
You looked like you.
You were just...

1189
01:10:50,379 --> 01:10:52,549
Just doing it, bro.

1190
01:10:53,348 --> 01:10:55,086
She writes too.

1191
01:10:56,052 --> 01:10:58,219
- She wrote that tune?
- Yeah.

1192
01:10:58,221 --> 01:11:01,589
Bunch of others too.

1193
01:11:01,591 --> 01:11:05,727
Got hooked up with some
manager guy, wants to...

1194
01:11:10,133 --> 01:11:12,099
Yeah.

1195
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:14,704
- She's good, bro.
- I know.

1196
01:11:16,239 --> 01:11:18,741
Maybe she's a way out.

1197
01:11:21,744 --> 01:11:24,381
Ain't nothing to
be afraid of, bro.

1198
01:11:25,414 --> 01:11:27,283
You know, it's like...

1199
01:11:31,488 --> 01:11:35,325
I don't know...
You float out...

1200
01:11:36,694 --> 01:11:41,263
Float out at sea, and then
one day, you find a port.

1201
01:11:41,265 --> 01:11:43,730
Say, "I'm gonna stay here
for a few days."

1202
01:11:43,732 --> 01:11:46,734
A few days
becomes a few years.

1203
01:11:46,736 --> 01:11:50,306
And then you forgot where you
were goin' in the first place.

1204
01:11:51,574 --> 01:11:53,273
And then you realize,
you don't really

1205
01:11:53,275 --> 01:11:55,210
give a shit about
where you was going

1206
01:11:55,212 --> 01:11:57,214
'cause you like
where you're at.

1207
01:11:58,414 --> 01:12:00,183
That's how it is for me.

1208
01:12:00,883 --> 01:12:02,453
I like where I'm at.

1209
01:12:03,721 --> 01:12:06,654
I didn't even realize
I liked it so much

1210
01:12:06,656 --> 01:12:09,791
till I saw your ass sleeping
in the grass this morning.

1211
01:12:13,930 --> 01:12:15,395
Yeah, come on, man.

1212
01:12:15,397 --> 01:12:17,668
You can rest
in my daughter's room, bro.

1213
01:12:22,704 --> 01:12:26,940
I thought of a million things
to say to you on the plane

1214
01:12:26,942 --> 01:12:29,180
that I can't remember.

1215
01:12:30,646 --> 01:12:31,681
Jack...

1216
01:12:32,682 --> 01:12:34,384
Glad you're here.

1217
01:12:35,619 --> 01:12:38,219
You did make it
to Memphis after all.

1218
01:12:42,892 --> 01:12:44,328
Fuck.

1219
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:47,198
I won't do this again.

1220
01:12:48,565 --> 01:12:50,500
I won't come and find you.

1221
01:12:52,802 --> 01:12:55,471
Next time, you can clean up
your own mess.

1222
01:12:56,472 --> 01:12:58,274
You understand me?

1223
01:13:00,377 --> 01:13:02,245
How was the show?

1224
01:13:04,213 --> 01:13:06,583
It was fucking awesome.

1225
01:13:07,817 --> 01:13:09,453
I cut the dancers.

1226
01:13:09,852 --> 01:13:10,919
Dancers?

1227
01:13:10,921 --> 01:13:11,986
Yeah.

1228
01:13:11,988 --> 01:13:12,990
Oh.

1229
01:13:13,923 --> 01:13:15,359
Good.

1230
01:13:17,727 --> 01:13:19,995
Fucking dancers.

1231
01:13:19,997 --> 01:13:21,528
All you do is you just sing.

1232
01:13:21,530 --> 01:13:23,096
You made me so upset.

1233
01:13:23,098 --> 01:13:25,332
I'm sorry.

1234
01:13:25,334 --> 01:13:28,236
- I saw that video on YouTube.
- Oh!

1235
01:13:28,238 --> 01:13:29,403
It was great.

1236
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:31,542
Thank you so much.

1237
01:13:35,544 --> 01:13:36,747
Excuse me one second.

1238
01:13:38,882 --> 01:13:41,514
- What's going on?
- Do you have a plier?

1239
01:13:41,516 --> 01:13:42,983
Jack's okay?

1240
01:13:42,985 --> 01:13:45,586
I wanna cut the guitar
strings, not too crazy.

1241
01:13:45,588 --> 01:13:48,822
There used to be pliers
or something like that.

1242
01:13:48,824 --> 01:13:50,724
Uh... Yeah, yeah.

1243
01:13:50,726 --> 01:13:52,260
I don't know
where my mom is.

1244
01:13:52,262 --> 01:13:55,596
- Yeah. I understand that.
- I think you're pretty.

1245
01:13:55,598 --> 01:13:57,398
Me?

1246
01:13:57,400 --> 01:13:59,233
You think I'm pretty?

1247
01:13:59,235 --> 01:14:01,903
Thank you.
I think you're pretty.

1248
01:14:01,905 --> 01:14:03,638
It was real great,
and then

1249
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:05,639
Jack tells me
you wrote the song.

1250
01:14:05,641 --> 01:14:07,140
Yeah,
he got me to start singing

1251
01:14:07,142 --> 01:14:08,977
my own songs again.

1252
01:14:08,979 --> 01:14:11,412
He has a way of doing that.

1253
01:14:11,414 --> 01:14:12,947
Yeah, he does.

1254
01:14:12,949 --> 01:14:15,050
Does anyone want some
more mac and cheese?

1255
01:14:15,052 --> 01:14:17,888
Yeah? Here, sweetheart,
you want some?

1256
01:14:19,422 --> 01:14:22,422
Oh, there he goes.
What's up, man?

1257
01:14:22,424 --> 01:14:24,526
I understand what you said.

1258
01:14:24,528 --> 01:14:25,829
What the hell are you...

1259
01:14:42,378 --> 01:14:43,679
Are you kidding?

1260
01:14:43,681 --> 01:14:45,913
- That stupid?
- No. It's not stupid.

1261
01:14:45,915 --> 01:14:47,915
It wasn't a stupid thing
I just did?

1262
01:14:47,917 --> 01:14:49,884
Is that what you were doing
when you left the table?

1263
01:14:49,886 --> 01:14:52,854
I don't know. He told me he
was looking for some pliers.

1264
01:14:52,856 --> 01:14:54,456
I didn't know
what he was going to do.

1265
01:14:54,458 --> 01:14:56,098
I didn't think
he was gonna "do it" do it.

1266
01:14:56,692 --> 01:14:59,126
Oh, she has another ring!

1267
01:14:59,128 --> 01:15:00,629
Well, that's just temporary.

1268
01:15:00,631 --> 01:15:03,698
No, no, no.
Jack, wait a minute.

1269
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:07,001
Let's anoint this.
Let's do it today.

1270
01:15:08,605 --> 01:15:10,238
- Yo, for real.
- It's a good idea!

1271
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:11,572
No, you get the dress.

1272
01:15:11,574 --> 01:15:13,073
I'll call my cousin right now.

1273
01:15:13,075 --> 01:15:15,376
It's Saturday.
Nobody's gonna be in there.

1274
01:15:15,378 --> 01:15:17,478
- Let's go.
- You really wanna do that?

1275
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:19,913
That place has
a magical quality to it.

1276
01:15:19,915 --> 01:15:22,382
It what?
It has a magical quality?

1277
01:15:22,384 --> 01:15:24,117
- It does.
- What do you mean?

1278
01:15:24,119 --> 01:15:25,987
- I mean that church is special.
- We can go.

1279
01:15:25,989 --> 01:15:28,523
- I'll take you to get a dress.
- There you go, right there.

1280
01:15:28,525 --> 01:15:30,992
It'd be great!
Okay, you're coming

1281
01:15:30,994 --> 01:15:32,727
with us for sure
because you're...

1282
01:15:32,729 --> 01:15:37,165
I can't believe this.
What am I doing? Okay, sure.

01:15:54,116 --> 01:15:55,250
Thank you so much.

Do you take him?

1291

01:16:15,137 --> 01:16:17,505
- I listened to what you said.

01:16:17,507 --> 01:16:19,439
I can't believe he did it.

I can't believe it.

1299
01:16:21,511 --> 01:16:23,411
Now, one thing at a time,
okay?

1300
01:16:23,413 --> 01:16:24,781

She better come out soon,

1307
01:17:09,191 --> 01:17:10,925
- before they leave.
- Want me to check on her?

1308

to go pretty soon, so...

All right.

1310
01:17:16,466 --> 01:17:17,901
Ally.

1311
01:17:19,636 --> 01:17:21,171
I'm coming in.

1312
01:17:25,475 --> 01:17:27,611

1313
01:17:30,379 --> 01:17:32,145

I don't know
who the hell I think I am.

1315
01:17:35,517 --> 01:17:37,952
One song is fine,

1316
01:17:37,954 --> 01:17:39,354
but to put out a whole record,

1317
01:17:39,356 --> 01:17:41,956
I don't know
what the fuck I was thinking.

1318
01:17:41,958 --> 01:17:43,590
I don't know
about all of that,

1319
01:17:43,592 --> 01:17:45,761
but you definitely
look like a star.

1320
01:17:46,463 --> 01:17:50,098
- Really?
- Yeah.

1321
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:52,132
What do you think of her hair
and the look and the...

1322
01:17:52,134 --> 01:17:53,968
- Well, I discussed it with her.
- Yeah.

1323
01:17:53,970 --> 01:17:55,870
- No, I think it looks great.
- Was that your choice, or...

1324
01:17:55,872 --> 01:17:57,574
No, it was actually hers.

1325
01:17:59,976 --> 01:18:02,010
- No drink?
- What's that?

1326
01:18:02,012 --> 01:18:03,046
No drink?

1327
01:18:06,382 --> 01:18:07,783
No socks?

1328
01:18:09,584 --> 01:18:11,251
Touche. Touche, mate.

1329
01:18:11,253 --> 01:18:12,819
Yeah, I could never
get used to that,

1330
01:18:12,821 --> 01:18:15,122
the idea of not wearing socks.

1331
01:18:15,124 --> 01:18:16,456
Your feet get all...

1332
01:18:16,458 --> 01:18:17,959
No, actually
I'm wearing socks.

1333
01:18:17,961 --> 01:18:20,694
They're these kind of
little female insert socks

1334
01:18:20,696 --> 01:18:21,929
that work with these shoes.

1335
01:18:21,931 --> 01:18:23,464
Oh, you are.
You're just hiding them.

1336
01:18:23,466 --> 01:18:25,565
Yeah, I'm just hiding them.
That's right.

1337
01:18:25,567 --> 01:18:27,903
<i>Okay, now is this thing...
Yeah, there it is.</i>

1338

01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:18,722
Just one sec, sorry.
Just be a second, yeah.

1362
01:19:27,230 --> 01:19:30,197
It doesn't do you any justice,
I'll tell you that.

1363
01:19:30,199 --> 01:19:32,367
You always said
you liked my nose.

1364
01:19:32,369 --> 01:19:35,103
- I love your nose.
- It's real big up there.

1365
01:19:35,105 --> 01:19:36,636
I wish it was bigger up there.

1366
01:19:36,638 --> 01:19:37,871
The whole thing

1367
01:19:37,873 --> 01:19:40,507
should just be
your fucking nose.

1368
01:19:40,509 --> 01:19:43,144
Fuck all those people
who ever said anything.

1369
01:19:43,146 --> 01:19:45,714
Just put a billboard
of your fucking nose up there.

1370
01:19:45,716 --> 01:19:48,815
Just the nose?
That's so ridiculous.

1371
01:19:48,817 --> 01:19:50,350
Listen,
if I just don't say this,

1372
01:19:50,352 --> 01:19:51,989
I'll never forgive myself.

1373
01:19:54,423 --> 01:19:55,758
What?

1374
01:19:58,927 --> 01:20:02,662
If you don't dig deep
in your fucking soul,

1375
01:20:02,664 --> 01:20:04,801
you won't have legs.

1376
01:20:05,967 --> 01:20:08,337
I'm just telling you that.

1377
01:20:10,173 --> 01:20:13,176
You don't tell the truth
out there, you're fucked.

1378
01:20:14,845 --> 01:20:17,211
All you got is you, and what
you wanna say to people,

1379
01:20:17,213 --> 01:20:18,845
and they are
listening right now,

1380
01:20:18,847 --> 01:20:20,148
and they're not gonna
be listening forever.

1381
01:20:20,150 --> 01:20:21,852
Trust me.

1382
01:20:23,451 --> 01:20:25,452
So, you gotta grab it.

1383
01:20:25,454 --> 01:20:26,888
And you don't apologize,

1384
01:20:26,890 --> 01:20:28,756
you don't worry about
why they're listening,

1385
01:20:28,758 --> 01:20:30,256
or how long they're gonna
be listening for,

1386
01:20:30,258 --> 01:20:32,428
you just tell 'em
what you wanna say.

1387
01:20:43,905 --> 01:20:48,141
'Cause how you say it
is the stuff of angels.

1388
01:20:48,143 --> 01:20:51,345
Pop! Six to the right,

1389
01:20:51,347 --> 01:20:52,679

1390
01:20:52,681 --> 01:20:55,084
Hot! Ball, change.

Attitude.

1392
01:20:58,488 --> 01:21:00,254

1477
01:27:05,722 --> 01:27:08,525
Thank you.
How did you find that out?

1478
01:27:09,558 --> 01:27:11,160
Bobby told me.

1479
01:27:12,427 --> 01:27:15,095
He called. He said that

1480
01:27:15,097 --> 01:27:17,564
they wanna do
some Roy Orbison tribute.

1481
01:27:17,566 --> 01:27:19,300
They want me to sing and shit.

1482
01:27:19,302 --> 01:27:20,934
- Great.
- Some like supergroup thing.

1483
01:27:20,936 --> 01:27:24,638
But the point is, you got
nominated, and it's great.

1484

What about my song?

1490
01:27:41,990 --> 01:27:45,158
I fucking listened to it over
and over in the fucking...

1491
01:27:46,829 --> 01:27:48,263
You're not making any sense.

1492
01:27:50,265 --> 01:27:52,500
Yeah, just keep drinking.

1493
01:27:52,502 --> 01:27:53,733
That'll give you the answer.

1494
01:27:53,735 --> 01:27:55,435
Maybe I just fucking
failed you.

1495
01:27:55,437 --> 01:27:56,970
- That just kills me. I'm sorry.
- You what?

1496
01:27:56,972 --> 01:27:58,304
You failed me?

1497
01:27:58,306 --> 01:28:00,241
Yeah, you're embarrassing,
and it's just...

1498
01:28:00,243 --> 01:28:01,908
- I'm embarrassing?
- I feel bad for you.

1499
01:28:01,910 --> 01:28:03,911
- Yeah, I just... You know...
- I'm not fucking embarrassing!

1500
01:28:03,913 --> 01:28:05,379
- I just have to tell you.
- You're embarrassing!

1501
01:28:05,381 --> 01:28:06,781
And you know
what you're doing is

1502
01:28:06,783 --> 01:28:08,416
you're so embarrassed
of your fucking self

1503
01:28:08,418 --> 01:28:10,516
that you gotta put me down.

1504
01:28:10,518 --> 01:28:12,353
You're worried that you're ugly, and
you're not. I'm trying to tell you that.

1505
01:28:12,355 --> 01:28:13,353
So you need to
get all this fucking approval

1506
01:28:13,355 --> 01:28:14,554
by all these other people.

1507
01:28:14,556 --> 01:28:15,956
Why can't I just
be enough for you?

1508
01:28:15,958 --> 01:28:17,491
I don't need approval.

1509
01:28:17,493 --> 01:28:18,792
You know what I'd like is
for my boyfriend to love me.

1510
01:28:18,794 --> 01:28:20,294
Actually, for my husband
to love me.

1511
01:28:20,296 --> 01:28:21,828
Yeah, who's
your fucking boyfriend?

1512
01:28:21,830 --> 01:28:23,831
- You have a boyfriend?
- Yeah, I've got a boyfriend.

1513
01:28:23,833 --> 01:28:25,599
- That hurts.
- Yeah, I have a boyfriend.

1514
01:28:25,601 --> 01:28:27,000
Call me
your fucking boyfriend.

1515
01:28:27,002 --> 01:28:28,635
You're my boyfriend.

1516
01:28:28,637 --> 01:28:31,205
You're my boyfriend if you
don't treat me like your wife.

1517
01:28:31,207 --> 01:28:33,139
I don't even know
what that fucking means.

1518
01:28:33,141 --> 01:28:36,742
It means clean your shit up.
You're fucking messy.

1519
01:28:36,744 --> 01:28:39,313
- That's what it means.
- Well, that's not true.

1520
01:28:39,315 --> 01:28:40,715
- Oh, it isn't?
- Mmm-mmm.

1521
01:28:40,717 --> 01:28:42,983
Let's go. You wanna
be my drinking buddy?

1522
01:28:42,985 --> 01:28:44,251
Wanna practice?

1523
01:28:44,253 --> 01:28:45,352
I don't think
you could handle it.

1524
01:28:45,354 --> 01:28:48,589
You don't? Let me see.

1525
01:28:48,591 --> 01:28:50,357
And you know why? 'Cause
you're too worried about what

1526
01:28:50,359 --> 01:28:51,759
- everybody else is thinking.
- Here we go.

1527
01:28:51,761 --> 01:28:54,295
Here we go, Jack.
You want me to be your dad?

1528
01:28:54,297 --> 01:28:55,863
- Be your drinking buddy?
- Yeah.

1529
01:28:55,865 --> 01:28:58,331
Yeah, you couldn't be my dad
if you fucking tried.

1530
01:28:58,333 --> 01:29:00,134
He had more talent
in his fucking finger

1531
01:29:00,136 --> 01:29:01,701
than you have in
your whole fucking body.

1532
01:29:01,703 --> 01:29:04,505
So don't even fucking go there
about that, all right?

1533
01:29:04,507 --> 01:29:06,439
That's over the fucking line.

1534
01:29:06,441 --> 01:29:07,773
Why don't you
have another drink,

1535
01:29:07,775 --> 01:29:09,608
and we can just
get fucking drunk

1536
01:29:09,610 --> 01:29:11,511
until we fucking
disappear, okay?

1537
01:29:11,513 --> 01:29:13,147
Hey! Do you got those pills
in your pocket?

1538
01:29:13,149 --> 01:29:14,748
You're just fucking ugly,
that's all.

1539
01:29:14,750 --> 01:29:17,751
- I'm what?
- You're just fucking ugly.

1540
01:29:17,753 --> 01:29:19,685

01:30:27,757 --> 01:30:29,322
Something fell through,

1558
01:30:29,324 --> 01:30:31,660
to come back a few days early.

1559

1576
01:31:37,627 --> 01:31:39,859
They hired this fucking kid

1577
01:31:39,861 --> 01:31:42,464

"Paul Anka told me

- That's it! Do not...
- Direct quote!

1603

Anka actually said to him?

1604
01:33:20,329 --> 01:33:22,662

- He said,

"Would you please

01:33:24,665 --> 01:33:26,899

Yeah, I'm great.

They have me going in early,
so I gotta go now and then...

1620
01:33:53,494 --> 01:33:55,895
But I made sure that they
tell me where you're sitting,

1621
01:33:55,897 --> 01:33:57,230

01:38:43,651 --> 01:38:45,051
<i>This is a dream come true,</i>

1698
01:38:45,053 --> 01:38:46,519
<i>and all I can say is...</i>

1699
01:38:46,521 --> 01:38:48,354
<i>...believe in yourself,
and don't give up</i>

1700
01:38:48,356 --> 01:38:50,523
<i>because there is a spot
on that stage for you.</i>

1701
01:38:50,525 --> 01:38:52,992
- Oh, shit. Oh, fuck.
- <i>Good night.</i>

1702
01:38:56,899 --> 01:38:59,032
- I think I peed myself.
- Baby, just turn around.

1703
01:38:59,034 --> 01:39:00,369
Oh!

1704
01:39:02,070 --> 01:39:04,071
- I think I do...
- Baby, baby, can you...

1705
01:39:04,073 --> 01:39:05,904
- I think that's a bad come down.
- Holy shit!

1706
01:39:05,906 --> 01:39:07,340
- Just take him to the shower. Go to the left.
- Follow me, Wolf.

1707
01:39:07,342 --> 01:39:09,242
Ally, you just go
inside, okay?

1708
01:39:09,244 --> 01:39:11,044
- It's on the left, Dad.
- I got it.

1709
01:39:11,046 --> 01:39:12,578
- Go inside!
- They got him,

1710
01:39:12,580 --> 01:39:14,113
- they got him. They got him!
- It's my job!

1711
01:39:14,115 --> 01:39:15,515
Don't you fucking
do this to my daughter.

1712
01:39:15,517 --> 01:39:16,683
Hey, hey!

1713
01:39:16,685 --> 01:39:18,151
What the fuck is
wrong with you?

1714
01:39:18,153 --> 01:39:20,720
Get off!

1715
01:39:20,722 --> 01:39:24,523
Damn it!
Watch his fucking head.

1716
01:39:24,525 --> 01:39:26,494
What, what?

1717
01:39:27,796 --> 01:39:29,565
Bobby'll take you there.

1718
01:39:31,031 --> 01:39:33,832
You have Bobby's number?

1719
01:39:35,037 --> 01:39:37,539
No, Jack, hon,
you gotta sit up.

1720
01:39:38,906 --> 01:39:41,974
I don't want you to choke,
baby. Sit up!

1721
01:39:41,976 --> 01:39:44,411
All right,
I might've taken too much.

1722
01:39:44,413 --> 01:39:45,746
You all right in there?

1723
01:39:45,748 --> 01:39:47,149
I'm fine.

1724
01:39:48,549 --> 01:39:50,518
He's fine.

1725
01:39:53,421 --> 01:39:56,055
So,
everybody has their journal,

1726
01:39:56,057 --> 01:39:58,457
and we remember
the homework assignment,

1727
01:39:58,459 --> 01:40:01,961
the three things that
I wanted you to write down.

1728
01:40:01,963 --> 01:40:03,296
Jack, hey.

1729
01:40:03,298 --> 01:40:05,000
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I'm late.

1730
01:40:05,833 --> 01:40:07,869
You can't be late, Jack.

1731
01:40:08,604 --> 01:40:10,237
Understood, sorry.

1732
01:40:10,239 --> 01:40:12,607
Good, where's your journal?

1733
01:40:14,208 --> 01:40:17,078
- It's in my room.
- No, no, no.

1734
01:40:18,314 --> 01:40:20,580
Sit down.

1735
01:40:20,582 --> 01:40:23,483
So, it's all agreed. Nobody's
ever late here, right?

1736
01:40:23,485 --> 01:40:25,855
Okay. Good.

1737
01:40:27,056 --> 01:40:29,456
Anything you wanna tell us?

1738
01:40:29,458 --> 01:40:30,593
Um...

1739
01:40:35,431 --> 01:40:37,132
I'm grateful to...

1740
01:40:39,601 --> 01:40:41,237
To be here

1741
01:40:43,137 --> 01:40:45,140
and trying to
hold it together.

1742
01:40:48,243 --> 01:40:50,443
I'm Jack. I'm an alcoholic.

1743
01:40:50,445 --> 01:40:52,379
Jack.

1744
01:40:52,381 --> 01:40:53,883
Drug addict.

1745
01:41:09,597 --> 01:41:11,029
This is all my fault.

1746
01:41:11,031 --> 01:41:12,364
You don't have
that kind of power, Dad.

1747
01:41:12,366 --> 01:41:15,067
Eat your dinner.
Eat your food.

1748
01:41:15,069 --> 01:41:16,736
I don't even know
what meal it is.

1749
01:41:19,074 --> 01:41:20,676
Go and have some fruit.

1750
01:41:23,211 --> 01:41:26,582
How many times did you carry
my piano up the stairs?

1751
01:41:28,382 --> 01:41:31,419
How many times did you sit
there while I wrote a song?

1752
01:41:35,056 --> 01:41:38,224
- Always.
- Okay, it's okay. It's okay.

1753
01:41:38,226 --> 01:41:40,629
You didn't do anything.
It's not your fault.

1754
01:41:43,231 --> 01:41:46,936
You're just the greatest
person in the world.

1755
01:41:54,176 --> 01:41:56,979
<i>How long have you
been here now?</i>

1756
01:41:57,913 --> 01:41:59,381
<i>Two months.</i>

1757
01:42:01,917 --> 01:42:03,483
Can it be fixed?

1758
01:42:03,485 --> 01:42:04,850
Well, you would know that,
don't you?

1759
01:42:04,852 --> 01:42:06,086
Once it's gone, it's gone.

1760
01:42:06,088 --> 01:42:07,553
I don't know what you have.

1761
01:42:07,555 --> 01:42:09,389
Oh, well, the tinnitus,
they say, once you...

1762
01:42:09,391 --> 01:42:13,291
- Oh, tinnitus can't be fixed.
- Right.

1763
01:42:13,293 --> 01:42:15,627
Well, I just hear that tone,
that's all.

1764
01:42:15,629 --> 01:42:17,531
The tone, yeah.

1765
01:42:17,533 --> 01:42:19,465
The ringing.

1766
01:42:19,467 --> 01:42:20,968
I have hearing aids on,
as you...

1767
01:42:20,970 --> 01:42:22,736
No, I know.
That's why I asked you.

1768
01:42:22,738 --> 01:42:24,573
You know, I'm convinced that

1769
01:42:26,141 --> 01:42:28,440
it happened when I
was younger, I used to...

1770
01:42:28,442 --> 01:42:32,545
My dad had a Victrola,
an old record player.

1771
01:42:32,547 --> 01:42:35,348
My head was just about the
size of it when I was a kid,

1772
01:42:35,350 --> 01:42:39,085
and I used to love to just
put my whole head in there.

1773
01:42:39,087 --> 01:42:43,656
He was big into
the blues, so...

1774
01:42:43,658 --> 01:42:46,658
'Cause you gotta figure, it's
just me and him all day long.

1775
01:42:46,660 --> 01:42:51,232
My brother's out there tryin'
to make something of himself.

1776
01:42:52,366 --> 01:42:54,067
So I took one of his belts.

1777
01:42:54,069 --> 01:42:58,473
I put it around
the ceiling fan

1778
01:43:00,040 --> 01:43:01,677
and tried to do the deed.

1779
01:43:03,412 --> 01:43:06,144
The whole fucking fan
came out of the ceiling.

1780
01:43:14,088 --> 01:43:17,123
Had a big cut
on my fucking forehead.

1781
01:43:17,125 --> 01:43:21,262
I was more mad about that
than it not working.

1782
01:43:22,963 --> 01:43:24,799
And he didn't even notice.

1783
01:43:26,234 --> 01:43:27,599
He didn't even fucking notice.

1784
01:43:27,601 --> 01:43:29,704
- 'Cause he was drunk?
- Yeah.

1785
01:43:32,106 --> 01:43:36,177
That fucking fan stayed on the
floor for about half a year.

1786
01:43:38,279 --> 01:43:40,345
How old were you then?

1787
01:43:40,347 --> 01:43:42,784
I was just shy of 13.

1788
01:43:51,258 --> 01:43:52,493
Aww!

1789
01:43:58,031 --> 01:43:59,732
You smell good.

1790
01:43:59,734 --> 01:44:03,204
You smell good,
and you look good too.

1791
01:44:06,975 --> 01:44:08,407
Swimming. I've been swimming.

1792
01:44:08,409 --> 01:44:09,709
- You've been swimming?
- Yeah, there's a pool.

1793
01:44:09,711 --> 01:44:11,676
- I love that you're swimming.
- Yeah.

1794
01:44:11,678 --> 01:44:14,179
- That's a great pool there.
- Yeah.

1795
01:44:14,181 --> 01:44:15,881
How's Charlie?

1796
01:44:15,883 --> 01:44:17,684
Oh, Charlie's sweet.

1797
01:44:17,686 --> 01:44:20,489
He just sort of sits
by the door like this.

1798
01:44:23,391 --> 01:44:25,259
Waiting for daddy.

1799
01:44:29,129 --> 01:44:31,165
We're both waiting for daddy.

1800
01:44:34,101 --> 01:44:36,602
What, three weeks?

1801
01:44:36,604 --> 01:44:38,272
You are gonna
come back, right?

1802
01:44:39,807 --> 01:44:41,073
What do you mean?

1803
01:44:41,075 --> 01:44:43,710
You gonna come home
when you're done?

1804
01:44:43,712 --> 01:44:46,179
- Do you not want me to?
- No, I want you to.

1805
01:44:46,181 --> 01:44:48,480
I'm just wondering if...
I just...

1806
01:44:48,482 --> 01:44:49,916
- Where else would I go?
- I don't know.

1807
01:44:49,918 --> 01:44:51,716
I guess I just thought...
You know, it's like...

1808
01:44:51,718 --> 01:44:53,853
- There's Jack...
- Wait, wait, wait.

1809
01:44:53,855 --> 01:44:56,421
- Why would you say that?
- I don't know. I guess...

1810
01:44:56,423 --> 01:44:58,224
I wondered, without the booze,

1811
01:44:58,226 --> 01:44:59,893
if you would want
to come home.

1812
01:44:59,895 --> 01:45:01,426
'Cause when you met me,
you were drinking,

1813
01:45:01,428 --> 01:45:03,263
and now you're not.

1814
01:45:03,265 --> 01:45:05,398
I wasn't drunk the whole time
we were together.

1815
01:45:05,400 --> 01:45:07,569
I know, but...

1816
01:45:08,770 --> 01:45:11,470
But it got bad
when we were together.

1817
01:45:11,472 --> 01:45:13,572
It's okay. I mean, it's fine.

1818
01:45:13,574 --> 01:45:16,108
I just was wondering,
that's all,

1819
01:45:16,110 --> 01:45:19,511
and whatever you want is okay.

1820
01:45:19,513 --> 01:45:21,913
Whatever I want?
I wanna be with you.

1821
01:45:21,915 --> 01:45:25,117
- That's why I'm here.
- Okay, I know, I know.

1822
01:45:25,119 --> 01:45:27,622
I just want you to be happy.

1823
01:45:28,890 --> 01:45:30,625
I'm working on that.

1824
01:45:34,361 --> 01:45:36,297
I need to stick with you.

1825
01:45:39,967 --> 01:45:41,502
I brought something.

1826
01:45:44,172 --> 01:45:45,507
I wanna know

1827
01:45:46,908 --> 01:45:48,442
what this is.

1828
01:45:49,944 --> 01:45:52,278
"My Love."

1829
01:45:52,280 --> 01:45:53,915
You hiding love songs?

1830
01:45:55,016 --> 01:45:56,815
No, I wouldn't...

1831
01:45:56,817 --> 01:45:59,887
I wouldn't say
I was hiding it. I just...

1832
01:46:02,323 --> 01:46:03,822
I started puttin' it
down to paper

1833
01:46:03,824 --> 01:46:05,326
when we were at home.

1834
01:46:07,829 --> 01:46:09,996
I don't know, it just
sort of fell out of me,

1835
01:46:09,998 --> 01:46:12,301
I guess, and onto this page.

1836
01:46:15,736 --> 01:46:18,406
And I put it in here,
and I thought...

1837
01:46:20,775 --> 01:46:24,479
I thought
maybe you'd find it

1838
01:46:27,615 --> 01:46:29,818
when you came
back to you, maybe.

1839
01:46:39,159 --> 01:46:40,729
Well, I found it.

1840
01:46:48,903 --> 01:46:50,539
Listen.

1841
01:46:55,776 --> 01:46:57,279
I'm, uh...

1842
01:47:12,092 --> 01:47:14,693
I'm sorry.

1843
01:47:20,802 --> 01:47:22,404
It's okay.

1844
01:47:25,940 --> 01:47:28,439
I...

1845
01:47:28,441 --> 01:47:31,042
It's okay.
It's not your fault.

1846
01:47:31,044 --> 01:47:33,015
I'm sorry I did that.

1847
01:47:35,149 --> 01:47:36,882
It's okay.

1848
01:47:36,884 --> 01:47:39,553
It's not your fault.
It's a disease.

1849
01:47:41,556 --> 01:47:43,625
No, but I embarrassed you.

1850
01:47:45,692 --> 01:47:49,429
- I embarrassed you, and I...
- I'm not embarrassed of you.

1851
01:47:49,431 --> 01:47:52,197
It was so wrong.

1852
01:47:52,199 --> 01:47:55,002
And then your dad...

1853
01:47:57,471 --> 01:47:59,574
My father loves you,
it's okay.

1854
01:48:02,110 --> 01:48:03,879
I know, but I...

1855
01:48:06,280 --> 01:48:09,114
- It's okay.
- I know, but I...

1856
01:48:09,116 --> 01:48:10,552
It's okay.

1857
01:48:12,153 --> 01:48:13,689
It's okay.

1858
01:48:14,789 --> 01:48:16,522
<i>I have figured out
what I think is</i>

1859
01:48:16,524 --> 01:48:18,491
the best solution
for both of us.

1860
01:48:18,493 --> 01:48:20,725
Jack should come out
on tour with me.

1861
01:48:20,727 --> 01:48:23,395
We'll start with our duets.
I know he's gonna be able

1862
01:48:23,397 --> 01:48:24,663
to play by himself.

1863
01:48:24,665 --> 01:48:26,331
You realize
that's not an option.

1864
01:48:26,333 --> 01:48:29,635
He's so inside of his art
in a way he has never been.

1865
01:48:29,637 --> 01:48:32,304
- He can hear himself again.
- Ally, there is no way

1866
01:48:32,306 --> 01:48:36,511
that you can take Jack on tour
with you. There is no way.

1867
01:48:48,923 --> 01:48:50,889
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

1868
01:48:50,891 --> 01:48:52,824
You know what? If you can't
make that happen,

1869
01:48:52,826 --> 01:48:55,186
then fucking cancel the tour.
I don't know what to tell you.

1870
01:49:13,414 --> 01:49:15,281
I think if we had
a better band name,

1871
01:49:15,283 --> 01:49:16,951
we might've made it.

1872
01:49:19,720 --> 01:49:21,153
Or maybe it was 'cause

1873
01:49:21,155 --> 01:49:23,421
we looked like
a father and son duo.

1874
01:49:24,725 --> 01:49:27,160
Not many of those around.

1875
01:49:27,162 --> 01:49:30,830
I was not a good look for you,
that's for sure.

1876
01:49:30,832 --> 01:49:33,532
Not my fault I couldn't find
a better guitar player

1877
01:49:33,534 --> 01:49:35,936
in the whole goddamn state.

1878
01:49:42,043 --> 01:49:44,410
Where in the fuck is it?

1879
01:49:44,412 --> 01:49:45,780
Right here.

1880
01:49:53,788 --> 01:49:55,589
Thanks for the ride.

1881
01:49:58,659 --> 01:50:00,194
Sure thing, Jack.

1882
01:50:02,396 --> 01:50:06,167
Hey, you know, uh...
When I, um...

1883
01:50:14,042 --> 01:50:16,477
When I said I would...
You know, when I...

1884
01:50:23,851 --> 01:50:26,154
Took your voice, you know.

1885
01:50:35,363 --> 01:50:37,865
It's you
I idolized. It wasn't Dad.

1886
01:51:29,284 --> 01:51:31,119
What was that guy?

1887
01:51:41,462 --> 01:51:42,964
Hey.

1888
01:51:43,497 --> 01:51:45,165
Hey.

1889
01:51:46,600 --> 01:51:48,634
I wanna know
how you hear this.

1890
01:51:50,137 --> 01:51:52,071
That sounded unbelievable,
what you were playing.

1891
01:51:52,073 --> 01:51:54,406
- Thank you.
- It's nice to hear it.

1892
01:51:54,408 --> 01:51:55,808
Thank you, and I had

1893
01:51:55,810 --> 01:51:58,443
the beautiful backdrop
of you and Charlie.

1894
01:52:00,013 --> 01:52:01,779
I only heard it in my mind for

1895
01:52:01,781 --> 01:52:05,550
so many weeks,
so it's good to hear it...

1896
01:52:05,552 --> 01:52:06,853
The words are beautiful.

1897
01:52:06,855 --> 01:52:08,921
In the real thing.
In the real thing.

1898
01:52:14,128 --> 01:52:16,260
- Well, you want me to do that?
- Mmm-hmm.

1899
01:52:16,262 --> 01:52:19,430
Oh, God, I don't know.
I knew you were gonna ask me.

1900
01:52:44,859 --> 01:52:46,727
Back from the dead.

1901
01:52:48,829 --> 01:52:50,194
Hey, sorry.
Were you waiting long?

1902
01:52:50,196 --> 01:52:51,932
Hey, Jack. No, no.

1903
01:52:52,799 --> 01:52:54,934
Uh... Ally's not home.

1904
01:52:54,936 --> 01:52:57,470
No, I told her I'd meet her
here, if that's okay.

1905
01:52:57,472 --> 01:52:58,974
Of course, yeah.

1906
01:53:04,546 --> 01:53:06,077
Here you go.

1907
01:53:06,079 --> 01:53:09,447
Hey, thanks for taking care of
my girl when I was gone.

1908
01:53:09,449 --> 01:53:10,985
Anything for her.

1909
01:53:12,186 --> 01:53:15,220
She told me about
that European leg.

1910
01:53:15,222 --> 01:53:16,822
That's a hell
of an accomplishment

1911
01:53:16,824 --> 01:53:18,858
this soon out of the gate.

1912
01:53:18,860 --> 01:53:22,260
Shit, I remember
it was like ten years

1913
01:53:22,262 --> 01:53:24,330
before I even went
across the pond.

1914
01:53:24,332 --> 01:53:26,364
It was summer, 2004.

1915
01:53:26,366 --> 01:53:28,268
Shit, was it?

1916
01:53:33,807 --> 01:53:35,976
We're not exactly
friends here.

1917
01:53:39,047 --> 01:53:40,379
While you've been away,

1918
01:53:40,381 --> 01:53:41,947
we've been back here
in serious triage,

1919
01:53:41,949 --> 01:53:44,349
trying to clean up
your fucking mess.

1920
01:53:44,351 --> 01:53:47,055
Barely finding
our way through it.

1921
01:53:48,388 --> 01:53:50,656
You almost single-handedly
derailed her whole career.

1922
01:53:50,658 --> 01:53:52,890
You understand that?

1923
01:53:52,892 --> 01:53:54,796
She's never gonna
say this to you.

1924
01:53:55,896 --> 01:53:57,832
She loves you too much.

1925
01:53:59,499 --> 01:54:01,968
Just by staying married to
you, she looks like a joke.

1926
01:54:01,970 --> 01:54:05,202
It's embarrassing.

1927
01:54:05,204 --> 01:54:07,540
Let's be honest, we both know
it's only a matter of time

1928
01:54:07,542 --> 01:54:10,745
before that's pushed aside
again for the real thing.

1929
01:54:11,477 --> 01:54:13,381
And when that happens,

1930
01:54:14,647 --> 01:54:17,151
I don't want her
anywhere near you.

1931
01:54:28,195 --> 01:54:29,197
Hey.

1932
01:54:33,066 --> 01:54:35,600
I have some good news.

1933
01:54:35,602 --> 01:54:37,437
- Yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

1934
01:54:37,439 --> 01:54:40,072
I'm not gonna go to Europe.

1935
01:54:40,074 --> 01:54:42,174
We're gonna cancel
the rest of the tour,

1936
01:54:42,176 --> 01:54:44,812
and I'm just gonna
be here all summer.

1937
01:54:46,981 --> 01:54:48,883
Isn't that great?

1938
01:54:50,450 --> 01:54:51,849
What happened?

1939
01:54:51,851 --> 01:54:53,685
Nothing happened.

1940
01:54:53,687 --> 01:54:55,688
The label just
loves the record,

1941
01:54:55,690 --> 01:54:56,955
and it's doing so well,

1942
01:54:56,957 --> 01:55:00,626
and they wanna keep
with the momentum

1943
01:55:00,628 --> 01:55:02,961
and have me make another one.

1944
01:55:02,963 --> 01:55:06,433
Rez is super psyched,
so it'll be great.

1945
01:55:08,802 --> 01:55:11,439
So tonight's
gonna be my last show.

1946
01:55:12,472 --> 01:55:15,342
Going out with
a bang at the Forum.

1947
01:55:18,378 --> 01:55:19,545
Great.

1948
01:55:19,547 --> 01:55:21,049
Yeah.

1949
01:55:24,718 --> 01:55:26,887
Why don't you come with me?

1950
01:55:28,655 --> 01:55:30,089
We can sing "Shallow"
together.

1951
01:55:30,091 --> 01:55:32,826
The fans will go crazy
to see you.

1952
01:55:36,231 --> 01:55:38,199
Come on, cowboy.

1953
01:55:42,736 --> 01:55:44,538
Yeah, why not? Okay.

1954
01:55:46,341 --> 01:55:47,773
Yeah?

1955
01:55:47,775 --> 01:55:49,207
Okay, good.

1956
01:55:49,209 --> 01:55:51,477
I'll have a car come get you.

1957
01:55:51,479 --> 01:55:53,179
Once I get there.

1958
01:55:53,181 --> 01:55:54,982
I'll go meet you there.

1959
01:56:03,958 --> 01:56:06,027
I'll see you soon, okay?

1960
01:56:10,530 --> 01:56:11,533
Hey.

1961
01:56:12,699 --> 01:56:13,901
What?

1962
01:56:16,303 --> 01:56:19,073
I just wanted to take
another look at you.

1963
01:56:23,910 --> 01:56:25,279
Bye, honey.

1964
01:56:26,180 --> 01:56:27,182
Bye.

1965
01:56:58,212 --> 01:57:00,011
Come here, Charlie.

1966
01:57:00,013 --> 01:57:01,382
Come here.

1967
01:57:37,418 --> 01:57:39,885
Thank you so much for
bringing us all here together.

1968
01:57:39,887 --> 01:57:43,688
Please look over all of the
dancers tonight and the band.

1969
01:57:43,690 --> 01:57:45,056
And my husband, Jackson.

1970
01:57:45,058 --> 01:57:47,561
We're so excited for him
to be here with us.

1971
01:57:48,596 --> 01:57:49,929
We got a big night.

1972
01:57:49,931 --> 01:57:51,411
We're at the Forum. LA.
Let's do this.

1973
01:59:56,356 --> 01:59:57,889

1974
02:00:00,127 --> 02:00:01,292

1975
02:00:01,294 --> 02:00:02,728
He's not here.

1976
02:00:02,730 --> 02:00:04,130
He's not here?

1977
02:00:04,132 --> 02:00:06,430
We have to do "Shallow"
regardless, okay?

1978
02:00:06,432 --> 02:00:07,799
The guitar's up there.

1979
02:00:07,801 --> 02:00:09,367
Everything's gonna
remain the same, okay?

1980
02:00:09,369 --> 02:00:10,602
- What?
- The guitar's up there.

1981
02:00:10,604 --> 02:00:11,937
Everything's gonna
remain the same.

1982
02:00:11,939 --> 02:00:13,438
Both verses.

1983
02:00:13,440 --> 02:00:14,939
I'm sure it was just a bit
much for him, that's all.

1984
02:00:14,941 --> 02:00:16,242
Please send somebody
to the house, please.

1985
02:00:16,244 --> 02:00:17,742
I'm doing it right now.

1986
02:00:17,744 --> 02:00:19,745

1992
02:01:50,937 --> 02:01:52,839
I can stay, if you want.

1993
02:02:30,444 --> 02:02:32,443
Some kid started
singing one of his songs

1994
02:02:32,445 --> 02:02:34,481
in a bar I was
in the other night.

1995
02:02:37,784 --> 02:02:40,488
They're playing
his songs everywhere.

1996
02:02:44,223 --> 02:02:46,393
At first I got angry.

1997
02:02:47,828 --> 02:02:49,230
I don't know why.

1998
02:02:50,998 --> 02:02:52,866
I guess I felt like,

1999
02:02:54,200 --> 02:02:58,036
how can any of these people
feel like they knew him?

2000
02:02:58,038 --> 02:02:59,874
Who he really was.

2001
02:03:03,209 --> 02:03:05,479
But then something changed.

2002
02:03:07,147 --> 02:03:08,982
And it soothed me.

2003
02:03:11,685 --> 02:03:15,586
That it wasn't
all for fucking nothing.

2004
02:03:16,690 --> 02:03:19,593
The last thing
I did was lie to him.

2005
02:03:21,794 --> 02:03:23,497
Listen to me.

2006
02:03:25,332 --> 02:03:27,334
It isn't your fault.

2007
02:03:28,869 --> 02:03:30,471
It just isn't.

2008
02:03:32,373 --> 02:03:34,907
You know whose fault it was?

2009
02:03:34,909 --> 02:03:36,244
Jack.

2010
02:03:38,845 --> 02:03:40,381
That's it.

2011
02:03:41,781 --> 02:03:43,715
No one else.

2012
02:03:43,717 --> 02:03:45,919
Not you, not me.

2013
02:03:46,721 --> 02:03:48,019
No one but Jack.

2014
02:03:48,021 --> 02:03:50,621
I just keep

2015
02:03:50,623 --> 02:03:53,893
going over and over it,
over it in my head.

2016
02:03:58,065 --> 02:03:59,596
Jack talked about how music is

2017
02:03:59,598 --> 02:04:02,669
essentially 12 notes
between any octave.

2018
02:04:05,972 --> 02:04:08,743
12 notes
and the octave repeats.

2019
02:04:12,111 --> 02:04:14,015
It's the same story.

2020
02:04:15,147 --> 02:04:17,784
Told over and over.

2021
02:04:18,351 --> 02:04:19,854
Forever.

2022
02:04:21,488 --> 02:04:24,523
All any artist
can offer the world

2023
02:04:24,525 --> 02:04:27,425
is how they see
those 12 notes.

2024
02:04:27,427 --> 02:04:28,829
That's it.

2025
02:04:35,836 --> 02:04:38,071
<i>He loved how you see them.</i>

2026
02:04:39,973 --> 02:04:42,573
<i>He just kept saying,</i>

2027
02:04:42,575 --> 02:04:46,012
<i>"I love how she sees them,
Bobby."</i>
